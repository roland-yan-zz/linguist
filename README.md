# Trivial

This website provides tools for more efficiently getting and **working with problems** on the [Art of Problem Solving Wiki](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/), either as a **single problem or a practice batch**, with **solutions shown** in a separate section. Numerous **filtering & display options** are supported, and **custom problem batches** or **individual problems & tests** can also be displayed. Attractive **article display** is also supported, with full **search & history** functionality. All of this can be viewed in the browser with a convenient layout or **printed out**.

## Maintenance

The only parts of this project that will need regular manual updating are the [allpages.json](data/allpages.json) and [allproblems.json](data/allproblems.json) page lists for the wiki. To download updated copies that can then be committed, run [downloadlists.js](downloadlists.js) in the browser console.
